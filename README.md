# Brain tumor segmentation and classification
- The code for the project and results are the ipynb notebook
- This project is done as part of completion of AI-2 the course offered by Univ.ai
- The best technical solution we have done in this project is to come up with the loss that gives more accurate segmentation i.e., summing up focal loss, dice loss and binary crossentropy
- Detailed explanation and solution can be found in the ipython notebook.
