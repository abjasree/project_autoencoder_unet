# project_autoencoder_unet
The code for the project and results are the ipub notebook
This is a group project done by us as part of completion of AI-2 the course offered by Univ.ai
The best technical solution we have done in this project is to come up with the loss that gives more accurate segmentation i.e., summing up focal loss, dice loss and binary crossentropy
